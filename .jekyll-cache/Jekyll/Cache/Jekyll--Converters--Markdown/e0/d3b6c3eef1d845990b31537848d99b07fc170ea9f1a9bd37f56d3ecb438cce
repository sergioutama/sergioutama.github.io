I"ð<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been playing around with <strong>react-native</strong> and wanted to implement facebook login.
It should be easy, isnâ€™t it. React-native is a framework developed by facebook and facebook has a nice guide how to implement facebook login within react-native.</p>

<p>However, I found some issues during installation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">react-native run-ios</code> will always produce compilation error in some part of its dependency</li>
  <li>the app will start to mentioning that the view doesnâ€™t have certain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">propTypes</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I was trying to debug the issue, finding my way over stackoverflow, documentations, github, etc to no avail
I ended recreate a new plain react-native app, and add the dependency one by one and try. Spending half of my day gone, I finally found the real culprit.</p>

<p>While following instruction on integrating react-native and facebook sdk. It relly heavily on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ios_setup.js</code>. This script should download the SDKs, extract it, configure the search path, and other configuration in <strong>plist</strong>, and you will expect it to <strong>just works</strong>. The script works, however there is one particular issue. the SDKs file that the script should download actually corrupted (I am not sure how, but itâ€™s corrupt). This couldâ€™ve been avoided if the script check the file MD5 or simple check wether the file successfully unzipped is great as well.</p>

<p>So the next time you tried integrating facebookSDK in your raect-native app donâ€™t forget to check the downoaded frameworks by the script, maybe, thatâ€™s the cause of your headache.</p>
