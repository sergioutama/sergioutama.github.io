2017 was a magnificent ride.

Amazing start, finished a project, went to tokyo attending conference, lost a job, started teaching full time, involved more in my startup (remotely still), stabed in the back by partner of my startup, losing customers, quit teaching, started freelancing, met new friends and teams, stucked with exhausting client, went to singapore attending conference, didn't get paid for a gig, helped friend on their startup, my startup generated 3000% revenue from initial capital (500% profit from capital), it was fun. There are several down period (I was depressed) yet things getting better.

I've no idea what 2018 hide. I do however have better grasp about my own life and what I want, what I need to do.
