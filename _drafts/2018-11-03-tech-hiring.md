My response :
There are so many issues, 
both on the candidate and employer. There are quite issue from the candidate such as wrong expectation, skill/talents, or attitude as mentioned above. However, my emphasise will be on the employer. 
Further, hiring is difficult, but retaining is more difficult.

Let's dissect.

When hiring my first and highest requirement will be attitude (or culture some people say). Skill, and the rest are situational, and can be addressed later based on need. That's the main issue on the candidate side. The rest of the issue often irrelevant and can be addressed from employer side.

Here's some issue on hiring and retaining talent in company that I often notice.

1. Don't understand the needs and capability of company and not having a hiring plan.

This is when employee trying to recruit candidate before really understand what kind of people they need. This also the first step when everything can goes wrong. Need things get done fast but no money, hire junior, or attempt to get senior dev but pay peanuts. You guys get what I mean. The question is do we really need junior / mid / senior dev at that time.

If you are new company and not having enough budget to hiring but need to get things going fast, you better of with 1 mid level dev and 1 junior dev, instead of 1 senior guy. Or maybe 2 mid level dev. Don't hire 3 junior dev to replace 1 mid / senior guy.

This is because Junior dev tend to require a lot of attention from management, they are not independent enough to do the task and require guides from mid or senior dev. Worst, if you let junior dev handle your infra. Nevertheless the employer need to have plan and really understand what kind of dev they need.

2. No talent or career pipeline

Once you hire, and dev complete the task, what do you want them to do?
This often issue when you made mistake above, especially when hiring senior dev. Don't let senior dev working alone too long or do menial task, it's hard to sustain them especially when they feel their work is boring. This also the same as junior. If you hire junior, you better prepare to hire mid / senior to help guide them. How your company grow each dev to their utmost potential. Most company doesn't have this in mind and think dev is just a coder.

3. Bad internal culture & Incompetent management

This is when company or manager, just tell the dev to do as they told.
Have rigid structure, process, or regulation. This is also when the company doesn't have a capable "manager". This is also when issue with generation gap often happen. No, there is no generation gap (I believe so). There is only manager who doesn't know what the team needs, what individual team needs, and what company can give in return. 

Eg: Your dev always complain about long hours, try understand the issue. Because often it's not because the long hours, sometimes it because too many task and they are burning out. Sometimes they have family to take care of. Try understand what is the real cause and come out together with solution. You might not let them do remote working every day, but they can go back early on Friday or work from home once a week. You might not be able to reduce work load, but you can spread it evenly and plan better, or simply reduce number of meetings.


That aside if the issue is salary, it can be offset with additional perks.
- Work from home
- Bonus from company profit
- Extra holiday
Or with interesting challenge / role / ability to grow

On hiring, employer has more control over the candidate.
However, most of employer often stuck on old way of management, or not understanding how to manage tech people.

I also need to admit whatever i said above might not be true for every company, there are bad apples from each side, and finding it is difficult. Especially if your hiring process is super rigid and only care about the skill.

Hiring based on attitude is difficult. It's difficult to justified and quantified yet, it's not impossible.

I just had the same discussion with few people last weekend about hiring. Long ago i was on the side : candidate sucks. Now, after being contacted by recruiter or company and help few companies build their products, I notice the issue often lies on the employer / management.

Tech ecosystem in Malaysia is small, everyone knows everyone. If a company made a mistakes, it's easier for the employee who has bad experience to spread things around.

I even have a list of companies to avoid, lol, or at least "the manager" to avoid.

Hahaha, maybe so. But I do build products (whether it's for my company or previously as freelancer).

I mean, on hiring people will often point out issue with the candidate, yet rarely see and reflect on ourself as employer.
As far as my experience goes, the only thing i cannot solve is attitude issue, the rest can be solved with the right approach.
