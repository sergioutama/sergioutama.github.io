When choosing software development methodology, it seems obvious for most of developer to vouch for 'Agile'. Agile movement also swept business owner and manager with the hype. However, despite "Agile" as buzzword are spreading, the practice are often neglected.

There are still quite a number of company prefer to use the "old school" waterfall methodology, wether for their internal project or the one their outsourced.

Here is why you shouldn't waterfall your development

1. Slow
Do you notice how fast new apps appear on AppStore? Or a new company founded? Every single day you'll find a new company, a new apps, out there. Using waterfall, it means you will wait till every features completed, and that waiting game, might cost you a straight jab by your competitor or a new startup.

2. Expensive
What will happen if your development time takes, 6 months, before you can monetise it? Yes, you are loosing money. Every months you are not generating money, you are losing money. You can only monetise software developed with waterfall in the end. That assuming you don't have bugs, or no change request at all, which we all need to agree is just a myth. The longer you wait to release the app, the more expensive it become

3. Higher risk
Yes, you can expect, due to how slow waterfall methodology is, your project might even stretched way past it's deadline.
