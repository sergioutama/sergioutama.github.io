Couple of months ago I was involved in conversation with friend, about how some recruitment agency use Github profile to find suitable candidate. During that time we argue what are the criteria these recruitment agency use, is it the contribution? number of repository? number of stars?

I am in the position of disagreement on using Github as a way to measure performance or criteria of recruitment. The reason simply because not every developer use Github. Shocked? That's reality, not all developer actually interested with open source project or having project on github.

Some briliant developers I ever met often only has one or two project in Github with a long period without any activity in their Github profile. However, these developer has few things in common, **they have live beside programming, they are passionate and trying to contribute back.**

The key is to find consitency. If the candidate you interviewed doesn't have Github account, but has consistenly giving talk on cumminity event, sharing their opninion in their blog.
